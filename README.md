# Blockchain Project Using Truffle
In the first video, I used truffle install -g to install truffle.
Following that, the command truffle init was used to create a new contract called helloworld.
Changes have also been made to solidity.
The solidity package was installed in the Visula Studio code.
I then tried to execute the truffle build command after creating a migrations file.
Next, get private keys by using truffle development.
We may use truffle migrate to move contracts to our local network.
In the test folder, create a helloworld.js test file.
Install a secret.json file for the goerli faucet on the Ethereum mainnet using hardhat, alchemy, and a mnemonic.
